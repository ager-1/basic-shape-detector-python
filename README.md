# shape-detector-python
This is a very basic beginner computer vision project built using Python, OpenCV, and Matplotlib. The tool captures video from your webcam and performs real-time shape detection using an image processing pipeline â€” converting to grayscale, applying blur, thresholding, edge detection, and then contour detection.
