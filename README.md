# Real-Time Basic Shape Detection Tool

This Python script uses OpenCV to detect geometric shapes in real-time from a webcam feed. It applies standard image processing techniques like grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, thresholding, and Canny edge detection.

## Features
- Real-time shape classification (triangle, square, rectangle, circle)
- Preprocessing pipeline visualization using Matplotlib

## Language
- Python 3.13

## Libraries Used
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
